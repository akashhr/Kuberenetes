# To deploy the statefulset applications , cluater admin should need to create the pv and we need to a pvc 
# to be used by pods which is time consuming

# since we are not using local cluster we cannot use persistance vlume of the cloud provider like GCP
# AWS, azure hence no dynamic provisoning.


# To enable dynamic provisoining for a local K8's cluster we use NFS CLIENT PROVISONER.

# In dynamic provisoining we donot reate the pv we just create the VOLUME CLAIM TEMPLATE inside the
# pod specification which provison and creates the pv 

# Having deleting the pod donot delte the pvc and deleting pvc will not delet the pv as reclaim policy is DELTE
# this logic completly depends on the RECLAIM POLICY

# nfs client provisoner basically is the special pod which has a /persistance which is the mounted from /srv/nfs/kubedata
# which acts as a storage provisoner and we need to create a StoragClass and point the storage class to this nfs client
# provisoner pod
