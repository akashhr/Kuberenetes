# we are using MetalLb as a loadbalancer
# Install metalLb in K8's cluster using helm also create config map (range of Ip to be assigned for Load balancer) for deploymnet of MetalLb
# MetalLb installiation is done in metallb-system namespace

# Deploy nginx-ingress-controller thorugh helm
# If we are not using ingress controller we will be exposing all the service through a load balancer
# and if we are using cloud we might need to pay for all load balancer usage which is expensive
# by using ingress-controller we are creating one load -balancer and multiple ingress resources 
# we are configuring ingress-controller which acts as a reverse proxy
