# When load increases kubernete should increae the number of replicas and load balance the the incomming
# traffic amoug the replicated pods
# When CPU utilisation or Core Utilisation reaches the maximum threshold pods will be scaled up to 
# manage the incomming traffic and vice versa through horizontal pod autoscaling.
# We need to install metrics server to monitor CPU Core utilisation of the pods and nodes

# kc top pods                           gives CPU and memory utilisation of the pods
# kc top nodes                         gives CPU and memory utilisation of the nodes.
# above 2 command works only when metrics server is deployed.

# There is a colling period when pods will not auto scale(3 min) up or scale down (5 min)
